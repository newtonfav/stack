subtitle: Migrating from next-auth to stack-auth
---

You can easily migrate your existing next-auth project to stack-auth following these simple steps.

<Note>This guide only applies to an next-auth project using nextjs.</Note>

Run Stackâ€™s installation wizard on your existing project with the following code:

```sh title="Terminal"
     npx @stackframe/init-stack@latest
```

You also have the option to use manual installation. For further details, please refer to [Setup](https://docs.stack-auth.com/getting-started/setup)

After running the command, a `app/handler/[...stack]/page.tsx` file is created in your project, this file contains default pages for sign-out, account settings and more. You can learn how to customize them at [custom pages](/customization/custom-pages).

Create an account on [our dashboard](https://app.stack-auth.com/projects), create a new project, then copy your API KEY into your `.env.local` file.

you can now proceed to protecting your pages by updating your `middleware.ts` file with the following code.

```tsx title="middleware.ts"
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();
  if (!user) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/handler/sign-in", request.url));
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  // You can add your own route protection logic here
  // Make sure not to protect the root URL, as it would prevent users from accessing static Next.js files or Stack's /handler path
  matcher: "/protected/:path*",
};
```

you also have the option of protecting your client and server components, check out [Protecting pages](https://docs.stack-auth.com/getting-started/users#protecting-a-page).

You can now clean up your codebase from next-auth related files

- Delete `auth/[...nextauth]`
- Delete `auth.ts`
